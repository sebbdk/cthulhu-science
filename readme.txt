A'jar
	You are a human standing in a jar
		- Wait around, this seems like a nice jar
		- Smash your head into the glass
		- Dance like pretty pony

	Outside!
		As you leave the jar, your fellow scientist outside shrieks, 
		in what what yu assume is joy, over the fact that you finally made it out.
			- Talk science' to your collegue and show how him the schience of the jar
			- Give you collegue a hug, it's a been a while since you saw, and it's casual friday!

	Noise?!
		A loud ringing noise spread throughout the room, your ears start to leak a bit.
			- Investigate the source of these shinanigans!
				You find a curius looking bell-thing
					- Smash it
					- Smash it
					- Smash it
						You pummel the brass bell looking thing, with your fists, which shatters into a thousand pieces
							- Leave the room and look for donuts, the requirement for any good science!

			- Leave the room, you are leaking head-fluid all over the floor, and that is how you get ants!

The hallway
	The smell of donuts fills the hallway
		- take a deep breath
		- continue dow nthe hallway, science waits for no'one!

	A few of you fellow scientists enters the hallway followed by you good friend Hastur, they look quite distraught
		- Give Hastur a highfive!
		- Put your brother in a tentacle lock, it's time for his weekly beating
			As you huzzle with your brother you accidently step on something squishy, paying it no heed you deside it's time to move on
				- move on 
The cafeteria
	You enter the cantina, which is surprisingly empty, the counter and a plethora of scrumtchy edibles on it, that anyone could leave it alone, seems unthinkable to you.
		- gorge uppon the delicous donuts and meats laid out on the counter


The Toilet
